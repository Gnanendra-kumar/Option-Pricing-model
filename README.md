Option Pricing Model

This project implements the Black–Scholes Model for pricing European call and put options using Python. The notebook provides a clear, step-by-step explanation of the model, its assumptions, and how to compute option prices, greeks, and visualizations. It is designed for students, quants, and developers who want a practical understanding of financial derivatives pricing.

Features
1. Implementation of the Black–Scholes closed-form formulas
2. Pricing for European call and put options
3. Computation of key Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho)
4. Visualization of option behavior with respect to:
Underlying price
Volatility
Time to maturity
5. Modular, easy-to-understand Python code
6. Fully documented Jupyter Notebook

Model Overview
The Black–Scholes model provides a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options.
Key Inputs:
S – Current stock price
K – Strike price
T – Time to maturity (in years)
r – Risk-free interest rate
σ – Volatility of underlying asset

Outputs:
Call Price (C)
Put Price (P)
Greeks like Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho
